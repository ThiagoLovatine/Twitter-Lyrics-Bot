I was shorter than my dad's dining table
You were taller than my bedroom door frame
Hit me hard when I found height don't make a man, no
You grew smaller to me that Saturday when
You came crashing, crawling down through the back brush
Eyes were bloodshot and your leaden voice thin
You said, "I won't blame you now"
But I caught your cold somehow
Then you jumped right in
Oh, I wanna give you all of my love
But I watched you sink as they swam above
You are the land and I am the dove
My heart is heavy when you're high
So, for me, why won't you try?
Said you're sorry you were drinking through the day, then
Only stopped to let your lungs take the hit
You said, "I won't blame you now
But you lost my love somehow"
Then you jumped right in
Oh, I wanna give you all of my love
But I watched you sink as they swam above
You are the land and I am the dove
My heart is heavy when you're high
So, for me, why won't you try?

I was once a Sunday kneeler
When I saw the leadlight fall from the pane
I didn't know that the grass was not only greener
Upkeep is cheaper when you embrace the rain
So I jumped down to lay with my leadlight
Under your spotlight, I lay with the shards
And I didn't know that the ground was not only harder
Oh, but colder when you are not around
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't let possession make a fool of you
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't promise I'll be here to see this whole love through
So I ran with dreams to reach the skyline
Straight up that incline, I ran towards the blue
And I didn't know that the sky is not only wider
Oh, but clearer when I'm standing next to you
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't let possession make a fool of you
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't promise I'll be here to see this whole love through
Oh, I believe in trust you see
But don't you go and put your trust in me
I cost more than you earn
So tell me, boy, why didn't you ever learn?
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't let possession make a fool of you
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't promise I'll be here to see this whole love through

I gotta find myself a girl
Who makes me wanna take on the world
I gotta find myself a girl
Who makes my straight toes curl
See, I had a life in my head
I'd be pushing up that hill
Until those toes bled
And now I'm gonna learn this new stage
I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
I didn't see it coming, I must have shucked that rage
Yeah, I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
Yeah, now I'm alright, I'm doing fine
But I'll be pushing up that hill
Until I get what's mine
Yeah, now I'm gonna learn this new stage
I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
I didn't see it coming, I must have shucked that rage
Yeah, I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
Whoa
Ooh
Whoa

So shaky, so fine
Standin' up there, baby, oh, you look so divine
So harsh, that bright stage light
Showin' the first four rows that you don't wanna play tonight
But you know I want you to
You know I need you to
And I'll be there for you, darlin'
Even if it all falls through
So steady, so calm
Standin' up there, darlin', with the front row in the heel of your palm
So good, that bright stage light
Showin' the back four rows that you got it made here tonight
You know I want you to
You know I need you to
And I'll be there for you, darlin'
When it all starts to come true
You stepped down off our home ground
Said, "Good friend I am done"
Done
So I left the game as they yelled my name
Said, "Girl, you're my number one"
One
One
Mmm
So shaky, so fine
Standing up there, baby, oh, you look so divine

These new lines on my face
Spell out: "Girl, pick up your pace
If you want to stay true
To what your younger self would do"
And this kink in my walk
Makes me focus when I talk
If I can't trust my feet
Then it's my tongue I choose to keep
And I walk slow, so I can read
Let my head fall and my hips lead
Why'd you write the words so small?
Did you fool me? Are they words at all?
Or are you pulling down the veil?
Keeping grounded as you set my sail
By the time I pull it off
All my innocence is lost
And oh, I'm good, I think I'm good
Will I be great? Will I be great?
Is it money I wanna make?
Or is it sweet love for his sake?
And these new parts I now need
To help me function, help me feed
They are beyond my modest earnings
Oh, the girls, they keep turning up the heat
As if it's cold, but I'm hot, too hot to hold
I'll burn a hole right through the hull
When will I ever see the land?
Will I ever see the land?
Oh, water can't revive me
I need dirt in my hand
Will I ever see the land?
Will I ever see the land?
I know the ground will give me something
I know that it can
See, I have charm and I have sight
And I always try and do what's right
But I have faults, you know it's true
Especially when it comes to treating you well
I will work when all my thoughts are mine again
See, I was sure at the start, turns out I tried too hard
And oh, I'm good, I think I'm good
Will I be great? Will I be great?
Is it money I wanna make?
Or is it sweet love for his sake?
When will I ever see the land?
Will I ever see the land?
Oh, water can't revive me
I need dirt in my hand
Will I ever see the land?
Will I ever see the land?
Oh, the ground will give me something
I know that it can

Zach Braff, you look just like my dad
Back when I thought I had the best one
Oh, what a life it could have been
Me in the cradle, you on the screen
But you're too young to be a father to me
You're too young to be a father to me
Hey, Catherine Deneuve, you look just like my mother used to
When she loved me, oh, when she loved me
Oh, what a life, just you and I
Learning to walk as you read your lines
But you're too old to be a mother to me
You're too old to be a mother to me
Surely you're not saying the TV lied?
I truly believe that they would love me back in real life
Hey, kid at the bar, you know who you are, I've been
Starin' you down as I play this out-of-tune guitar, and
Oh, just think what we could be
I swear I'll dress cooler if you'll just go home with me
But you're too young to be a lover to me
(You're too young to be a lover to me)
I'm getting older but I forget sometimes, you see
(You're too young to be a lover to me)
Surely you're not saying the TV lied?
(You're too young to be a lover to me)
I truly believe that I will have it all in my life
So, don't you waste my time
Don't you waste my time
On small talk and cheap wine

Why'd you go to the grocery store
On the day you planned to leave?
You left me here with all this food
My body does not need
And now I'm lying listless
Like a dog after a feed
Thinking 'bout the life
That you'll now lead
Why'd you go and push in
When you saw my face in the line?
You said if I just focus
I could get laid anytime
But now I'm lying broken
Like a dog after a fight
I guess I was not made for your life
I guess I was not made for your life
There on Central Station
You forced my lips to scream
Loving you ain't easy, babe
It's just a L.A. dream
And I'll be lying happy
Knowing we still spent the time
I guess you were not meant to be mine
I guess you were not meant to be mine

I was dancing
For a while
See, I was trying to
Perfect a style
Out on that dance floor
Oh, boy, did I sweat
Shaking to get noticed
Has not worked for me yet
But I'll keep trying
See, I was swinging
My blonde hair 'round
See, I was trying to
Get my feet off the ground
And I rose steady
To the roof of my room
I may not be a great dancer
But I might be a good one soon
Yeah, I'll keep trying
Dancing for yourself ain't bad when you're dying to find
That sweet step that will help to free your mind


Same airport, different man
I'm starting to think that I don't know quite who I am
Same airport, different man
He sat in the car park, waiting for me to land
Same airport, different dress
This one's blue and it is longer than the rest
Same airport, different dress
Last one was short and red and too tight for my growing chest
Same airport, different life
At sixteen, lost my first love to a one-way flight
Same airport, different life
Sat down by the carousel, looking old enough to make a wife now
Same airport, different ride home
Last time I went to my mother's, this time to my own
Same airport, different ride home
Riding shotgun to my baby, next time I'll get the train alone
I'll get the train alone
I'll get the train alone
I'll get the train alone
Same airport, different man
He looks happy, he looks happy
Same airport, different man

Driving home, the road makes me feel smaller
My hard fear forces my hand into the shoulder
And I feel you, darling, on my own
Every mile brings you a little closer
Yeah, I'm driving into the Hay Plain
I won't survive the night if you won't stay in your lane
Yeah, I'm heading away from that wide sunset
Wondering if my new man misses me yet
Baby, you don't have to drive me around no more
I went and got myself a car, now I can pay you back for it
All the times you took me back home
And every mile brings you a little closer
Yeah, I'm driving into the Hay Plain
I won't survive the night if you won't stay in your lane
Yeah, I'm heading away from that wide sunset
Wondering if my new man is in love with me yet
And besides that truck driver on the Western Distributor
Who caught me changing, sorry, babe, he saw everything
I've been keeping my skin for when you fly in
And you want me, physically
And besides that night in Adelaide in the back of a cab
When a good man said he'd give me what I've never had
I've been keeping my eye for when you come online
And you need me, emotionally
I'm driving into the Hay Plain
I won't survive the night if you won't stay in your lane
Yeah, I'm heading away from that wide sunset
Wondering if my new man misses me yet

Don't let the kids win
Just let them lose
They're not gonna learn anything
If that's the way you choose to play
Don't let the kids win
Just let them fall
You don't want 'em growing up thinking
Two-year-olds are good at playing basketball
Don't let your grandmother die
While you're away
A cheap trip to Thailand's not gonna make up
For never getting to say goodbye
And don't let your brother
Stop thinking you're cool
Yeah, I know, he's got a girlfriend now and he's taller
But that don't mean he's stopped looking up to you
And I've got a feeling
That this won't ever change
We're gonna keep on getting older
It's gonna keep on feeling strange
Don't let your friends turn cold
While you burn to green
When they walk off the stage, embrace them
And say, "That's the best shit I've ever seen"
And don't let your sister
Walk down the aisle
Without pulling her close, saying, "I love you"
And, "It's okay if I don't see you for a while"
And I've got a feeling
That this won't ever change
We're gonna keep on getting older
It's gonna keep on feeling strange
And don't let the time go by
Without sitting your mother down
And asking what life was like for her
Before you came to be around
And tell her it's okay
If she puts herself first
Us kids, we'll be alright
If we're not the centre of her universe
And I've got a feeling
That this won't ever change
We're gonna keep on getting older
It's gonna keep on feeling strange
And after a late one
I don't know anything
Except the more I keep on talking
The less breath I got left to sing

It might make for good TV
The grieving process for all to see
But I don't want my fathers ashes
Scattered over strangers couches
And it might make for a fun night in if I
Wore a dress and slept with him
But I really hate showing my legs
Even when the Sydney summer begs me
Come on now your roots are showing
Unlike hands your hair keeps growing
Oh now love you could keep on dyeing
I think the truth is more age defying
And in the day when it gets dark
We were just two shelves apart
When we realised, it's not right
You are not in a garden, you are in a store
A single stemmed rose reaching out for more
Did it come as a great shock
When your third love said hey you're not
Gonna get his heart to beat by
Laying offerings at his feet
And in the day when it turned dark
We were two cages apart
When we realised, it's not right
You are not in the wild, you are in a pen
A forgotten sow wondering when you can run

Will I be a a mother or will I always be a child?
Does someone come and say, "Hey girl, it's your time"?
What if I'm dancing and I don't hear the door knock?
And some cold caller decides I'm not
Ready to change
Oh, what if my body is but my mind remains the same?
Will I be a mother or will I always be a child?
Does someone come and say your time has arrived?
What if I'm sleeping and I don't wake with the clock?
And I sleep right through it and some kind of god decides I'm not
Ready to change
Oh, what if my mind is but my body won't take to the stage?
I heard her screaming last night in my dreams
I tried to reach out and hold her
Can someone please tell me what that screaming means?
And not say, "Wait 'til you get older"?
Are you alright?
I have to see
Oh, my sweet sister
You've always been braver than me
Oh, what if my love is but I'm not ready to be?
I'm willing to change
Oh, it's not just me, he's also afraid

The police met the plane
They let you finish your meal
I know you'd like to believe it, baby
But you're more kid than criminal
Just a boy who could not
Get through a domestic flight
Without lighting up in the restroom
Got caught, cloud of smoke, thumb still on the light
You looked so proud
Couldn't wait to call a friend
We had to fly back home
Never got the money back for that weekend
Right there on the Sydney tarmac
I threw my luggage down
I said, "I'm gonna leave you
I'm not a good woman when you're around"
That's when the sound came in
I could finally see
I felt the changing of the seasons
All of my senses rushing back to me
Go your own way
Watch me turn my own head
Eyes on the driver, hands in my lap
Heading to the city to get my body back
I remembered early days
When you took my camera
Turned to me, twenty-three
Naked on your bed, looking straight at you
Do you still have that photograph?
Would you use it to hurt me?
Well, I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body
I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body
I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body
I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body
I guess it's just my life
And it's just my body

Give me a full-length mirror
So I can see the whole picture
My head alone gives nothing away
Guess I could stand on a chair
Put it back by the table before you get there
My head alone doesn't know how to say
I don't want to be touched all the time
I raised my body up to be mine, hah
He said, "Give me another drink"
You know it's easy to talk when you don't have to think
Well, my head alone won't do it that way
Come on, give me the room tonight
You know I've told you before that you hold me too tight
And my head alone just wants to say
I don't want to be touched all the time
I raised my body up to be mine
Yeah, I don't want to be touched all the time
I raised my body up to be mine
I have your back
More than I have mine
I want you to feel good
All of the time
So I'll say it 'til he understands
You can love somebody without using your hands
Yeah, I'll say it 'til he understands
You can love somebody without using your hands

Pressure to party, gonna stay in
Nothing good can come from me drinking
I would run, shoes off, straight back to you
I know where you live, I used to live there too
Pressure to feel fine after the fact
Out on the dance floor with my body back
Meeting a stranger, touching his face
I don't want anyone to ever take your place
Pressure to go strike out on your own
Pressure to learn from being alone
Pressure to not leave it for too long
Before you find another heart where you belong
Pressure to come up with conversation
Makes the family fine with my isolation
I know I've locked myself in my room
But I’ll open up the door and try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Pressure to act the right way around him
We're both in a crowd with people surrounding us
What do I do?
Don't know how it works
Pressure to not let the inside of my mind
Spill onto the floor for our friends to find it
Oh, what do I do?
'Cause God, how it hurts
Pressure to come up with reasons why
Sometimes it might look to you like I'm not even trying
I know I've locked myself in my room
But I'll open up the door and try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Try to love again soon
Try to love again soon

I wanna want you, I wanna stay here like this
I wanna feel it all every time that we kiss
I want your mother to stay friends with mine
I want this feeling to pass in time
But you know my body now and I know yours
We put so many things between these walls
And every gift you buy me, I know what's inside
What do I do now? There's nothing left to find
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
What if I cleaned up? What if I worked on my skin?
I could scrub until I am red, hot, weak, and thin
Too tired to run away, what do I do now?
There's nothing left to say
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Into the darkness, or is it the light?
Should I be waking up, or finding a place to sleep tonight?
Who will I be
Now that you're no longer next to me?
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
I just wanna keep loving you

I was sitting in my Corolla
Talking to you while my friends drank inside
There was a silence, weak telephone reception
Doesn't compliment a dark state of mind
You know it's bad when the family flies in
Working bees back to the hive
You know it's bad when the family flies in
Just to stand by your side
Oh, the last thing that I sent to you
Was an irrelevant music video
And I'll always wonder if you ever watched it
Thought you had longer to go
You know it's bad when the family flies in
Working bees back to the hive
You know it's bad when the family flies in
Just to stand by your side, oh
Well, goodbye
Well, goodbye

Do you really wanna give him the microphone?
You know that he'll keep talking long after everyone's gone home
We'll have to pay to keep the lights on
And that bill will arrive just when all our savings have gone
Can I say something? Can I give advice?
Just hit the main switch so we can sleep well tonight
My social standing got me six rows from the front
And my dinner companion was a little drunk
Says he buys the paper but he reads between the lines
"I can show you how I do it, why don't you come back to mine?"
Oh, please say something, I'm dying for your advice
I can tell you won't sleep well if you don't teach me how to do it right
Call me a ride, I can't walk home
Can't stand the pain from these shoes I've now outgrown

Tell me I'm the love of your life, just for a night
Even if you don't feel it
Tell me I'm the love of your life, just for a night
Even if you don't mean it
I don't care for the truth when I'm lonely
I don't care if you lie
I don't care if in the morning
You get up, not say goodbye
I don't care for the truth when I'm lonely
I don't care if you lie
Come on, breathe in, breathe out
You're still a good guy
Tell me I'm the love of your life, just for a night
Even if you don't feel it
Tell me I'm everything that you could find
And you don't wanna waste it
I don't care for the truth when I'm lonely
I don't care if you lie
I don't care if in the morning
You get up, not say goodbye
I don't care for the truth when I'm lonely
I don't care if you lie
Come on, breathe in, breathe out
You're still a good guy
Tell me I'm the love of your life, just for a night
Even if you don't feel it

Started listening to your favourite band
The night I stopped listening to you
You were always trying to force my hand
But now I'm listening because I want to
You were right, I liked it
You were wrong, I was a good friend
Started eating at your favourite place
The night I stopped eating with you
You were always trying to force my taste
But now I'm eating there 'cause I want to
You were right, I liked it
You were wrong, I was a good friend to you
Twin hotel room, no bed to make
What can I do to change myself for your sake?
I don't want you here
You make me feel so small, I'm gonna disappear
Started feeling like myself again
The day I stopped saying your name
We can try and start it up again
But it's never gonna feel the same
You were right, I liked it
You were wrong, I was a good friend to you

Learner driver
Going 80 k's
Tryna get to Melbourne
It's probably gonna take two days
Lover beside you
Gripping the door
Oh, you know why he is nervous
You have crashed before
It's a lot to ask of you
To believe in me
When I can't even promise
I'd do things differently next time
Pulled off the highway
Found a place to sit
He took my hand, said, "I see a bright future
I'm just not sure that you're in it"
It's a lot to ask of me
To believe in you
When I don't know if you'll ever love me
The way I want you to
So please just turn me down
Oh, please just turn me down
Why won't you turn me down?
Oh, please just turn me down
Why won't you turn me down?
Oh, please just turn me down
Why won't you turn me down?
Why won't you turn me down?
Don't look at me
Look at the centre line
Maybe I'll see you
In a supermarket sometime

You'll be okay, you'll be alright
You'll get well soon, sleep through the night
You'll go outside, enjoy the sun
Soon you'll feel fine to see everyone
He's gonna thrive, he'll be just fine
Hurt for a while, cured with time
Don't know how he's doing, but that's what you get
You can't be the one to hold him when you were the one
Who left
He's got good friends, they'll pull him in
Take him out dancing, help to begin again
Don't know how he's doing, but that's what you get
You can't be the one to hold him when you were
The one who left
Are you thinking of me too?
I was so happy all those years with you
I'll be okay, I'll be alright
I'll get well soon, sleep through the night
Don't know how you're doing, but that's what I get
I can't be the one to hold you when I was the one
Who left

I loved it there
That city held me
Don't you know that everything changes?
Inside the dream
A case for wanting
Don't you know that everything changes?
Everything changes
When the time comes
Will you get on that flight?
I got a feeling I won't do it alone
I got a feeling
But everything changes
Everything changes
Everything changes
Everything is changing
Everything is changing
I loved it there
That city held me
I got a feeling I won't do it alone
It's just a feeling though

Hiding my depression from my housemates
I don't know them well enough yet to cry in the kitchen
Shower head or the empty bed
I yell down the hallway, "I'm going to the store"
But instead I walk to the local football field
And I walk around in circles, find a quiet corner and cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Open your eyes, run back, baby
But they'll think that I am a liar if I come home empty-handed
Go, use your head, buy another loaf of bread
When I walk back through the door, I'll say
"You can never have too much bread," and try not to cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
I make them food
I make them laugh
I say, "I'll clean up
You should get an early night"
I stop and I wait
Stuck in my new state
I close the kitchen door and
Hold onto the sink and cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh, cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

She lost the baby, the house nearly burnt down
Baby Jesus is nobody's baby now
Watched him pick the pack of smokes out of the bin
This time of year has always been so hard on him
Last Christmas, at my aunty's house
I tried so hard to make my uncle shut his mouth
Grandma cried, "Can't this wait?"
Drink a cup of juice, try to celebrate
The family asked me to sing 'em all a song
Get up in the lounge room while they keep the TV on
Pick a fun one, everybody claps
Plates of cold cuts tremble in their laps
Watch me go to bed alone this year
There was someone I wanted, but they're no longer here
Grow up, girl, it's good for your health
To go to bed sometimes simply holding yourself
She lost the baby, the house might still burn down
Baby Jesus is nobody's baby now
Wanna be there to pick her up off the floor
But I've never had to reach this far down before
This Christmas, at my aunty's house
I'm gonna try so hard to open up my mouth
Say it loud, and hope it's true
Next year will be much easier on you
