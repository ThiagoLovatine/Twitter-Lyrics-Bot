Pick it up, pick it all up
And start again
You've got a second chance, you could go home
Escape it all, it's just irrelevant
It's just medicine
It's just medicine
You could still be what you want to
What you said you were when I met you
You've got a warm heart, you've got a beautiful brain
But it's disintegrating from all the medicine.
From all the medicine
From all the medicine
Medicine
You could still be what you want to be
What you said you were when you met me
You could still be what you want to
What you said you were when I met you
When you met me, when I met you
