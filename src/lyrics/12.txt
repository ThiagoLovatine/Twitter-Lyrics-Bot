Let the water rise
Let the ground crack
Let me fall inside
Lying on my back
Lying on my back
Dry your smoke-stung eyes
So you can see the light
Staring at the sky
Watching stars collide
Watching stars
If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows
If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows
When the time comes
On the last day
When they start to count down
Will you just
Will you run away?
Will you run away?
Let it all rain down
From the blood-stained clouds
Come out, come out, to the sea my love
And just
Drown with me
Drown with me
'Cause if you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows
If you leave
When I go
Find me
In the shallows
Lying on my back
Lying on my back
Lying on my back
Watching stars collide
