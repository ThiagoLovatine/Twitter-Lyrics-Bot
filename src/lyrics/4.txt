In my own time
I'm trying to reach out I know I'll get there soon
There's a hole in the earth here
And we're walking around the edges
You were flaunting all your open wounds
I can't express them better than you
You have buried childish qualities
Friend make sense of me, friend make sense of me
I have many destructive qualities
Friend make sense of me, friend make sense of me
It's like an old rhyme
Your father's a liar while my father's lying down
In a hole in the earth there
And I'm scared I'll forget him
I'm still haunted by those open wounds
I won't express them truly to you
You have buried childish qualities
Friend make sense of me, friend make sense of me
I have many destructive qualities
Friend make sense of me, friend make sense of me
I have so much hurt inside me
Friend make sense of me, friend make sense of me
I have so much hurt inside me
Friend make sense of me, friend make sense of me
Friend, friend, friend, friend
In my own time
In my own time
In my own time
In my own time
