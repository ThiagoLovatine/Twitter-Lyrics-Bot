I’m wasted, losing time
I’m a foolish, fragile spine
I want all that is not mine
And they will all agree that I’m a suffocator
I should go down quietly
But I bet I won’t
Losing all you have is never enough for me, right?
Never mind my wants; don’t let my past haunt me
I honestly might, just be better off without this
Even I can obviously fight; even if I had heart, I work hard, no time to use it
Indecisive as Dwight; if what I write down doesn’t work
Blink twice; no emotion; everyone loves life
Choking, weed smoke when I hit the stair well
Hit someone’s face with a blank stare, well it scared her
If I run away, will that make things better?
While I’m struggling to think; contemplating on whether I would ever even say
Or express how I’m feeling every single day, even when I was with Vale
Answer this: Tell me what’s worse
Not having parents at all, or having two people that honestly never cared?
Never mind hip-hop; this is life; explain why I’m wrong when I only did right
Or at least, tried my hardest to impress y’all
Even though I failed every single night
That’s cool though
Because now, I know our history and y’all screwed us
So, now I’m the black sheep of our family, which I find to be screwed up
And with that being said, I’ll never diss anyone, I just needed to vent
But how could you understand where I’m coming from, if you’ve never been?
But I bet I won’t
Losing all you have is never enough for me, right?
Never mind my wrist; don’t let my past haunt me
This cut was the last but the deepest
I wish every one of y’all could see this
I can’t deal; with thinking I’m not good enough
Not giving up, isn’t really making anymore sense
What’s pain to you?
Getting bullied was pain to me
Getting jumped was pain to me
Getting stabbed was pain to me
Losing both of my friends was pain to me
Its pain to see that my mom just stood there saying, you’re never going back to King
So get over it, while my dad just watched me watch him let it go down
He was over it, but I wasn’t
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Willing to give up yet; I’m looking for trust
Yes, mom did burn me; what an upset; are you up yet?
Because I don’t hold back anymore, lacking the love that was expected of y’all
Attacked when I was eleven years backwards
I ball; that’s only for my own sake
Bet if I fall, then I might as well suffocate
I’m overheated; no need for the love now
17 years that are down, the drain with the pain
Why can’t I ever really get by?
I won’t pretend I don’t try to vent
I must not descend to lows
I intend on being much better; a new star grows now
So, I have to be there when it goes down, hill
