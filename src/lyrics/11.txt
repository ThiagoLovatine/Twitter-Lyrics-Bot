Hardest Goodbye
I know you regretted love
I know you regretted love
Look, the hardest good bye
Is when you look me in the eyes
Tell me its gonna be alright
Ill see you next time
When really there is no next time
Your words are all lies
I guess ill just be fine
What choice do I have?
Im trapped inside
And just like NAV
I dont like who i am when i ain't high
But at the same time
When I stay high I ain't the same guy
So put a bullet up in my mind
Cause recently ive been disinclined
To listen to the voice behind
The shadows
And right now i need to rewind
So im sorry if im unkind
Im just no longer the nice guy
Who would check to make sure you're alright
Call your phone in the middle of the night
And I know this will make me fall behind
But its just what feels right
I know you regretted love
"See I knew that shit from the start"
I know you regretted love
"Round here to fuck with mans heart"
I know you regretted love
"like the red sea we were bound to part"
I know you regretted love
"And I knew this shit was never gonna last"
Look, And i dont regret shit
But the end of us is something that im gonna miss
The thoughts in my mind causing me to reminisce
As I know youll move on further into the abyss
Yet does this
Mean that its all over
I can't seem to stay sober
I think we need a takeover
But like a book to move onto the next chapter
You need to turn over
So what once had thoughts in mind
Telling me to end my life
Its not going to be alright
Disappeared and now I feel fine
I guess I just needed a guideline
To prevent me from still having love through the grapevine
All the time wasted on you to make sure that you felt right
And then when I needed you
You were never in my sight
And now im the one who doesnt feel right
So im mixing in the codeine with the sprite
To take my mind off and just get a high
Until I overdose and die
And even then I know you won't cry
Youll let it all build up inside
And then be left hanging by a neck tie
So i guess this was my hardest goodbye
