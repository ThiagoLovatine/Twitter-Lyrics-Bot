By tomorrow, we'll be swimming with the fishes
Leave our troubles in the sand
And when the sun comes up
We'll be nothing but dust
Just the outlines of our hands
By tomorrow, we'll be lost amongst the leaves
In a wind that chills the skeletons of trees
And when the moon, it shines, I
Will leave two lines
Just find my love, then find me
But don't bring tomorrow
'Cause I already know
I'll lose you
Don't bring tomorrow
'Cause I already know
I'll lose
I'll lose you
By tomorrow, I'll be left in the darkness
Amongst your cold sheets
And your shoes will be gone
And your body warmth no longer beside me
So don't bring tomorrow
'Cause I already know
I'll lose you
Don't bring tomorrow
'Cause I already know
I'll lose
I'll lose you
