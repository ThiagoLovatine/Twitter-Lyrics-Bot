Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force of love beginning
Oh, we've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
I'm up all night to the sun, he's up all night to get some
I'm up all night for good fun, he's up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave, I'm ready
Oh
'Cause we've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
I'm up all night to the sun, he's up all night to get some
I'm up all night for good fun, he's up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get some, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
Oh, we've come too far
Oh, we've come too far
Oh, we've come too far
Oh, we've come too far
To give up
Who we are
Who we are
I'm up all night to the sun, I'm up all night to get some
He's up all night for good fun, he's up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
