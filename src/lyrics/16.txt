With all the fortune
Snatch at our hearts
And when ourhungerhearts
Until we find what we crave
We fall for a fortune
I save my soul for a lie, lie, lie
...my son of a spell
Our vows were made to be broken
...was made to swing
...was made to swing
Upon the shadow of a long ago moon
We're on a course fixed by fire
She says me lies
This is the prize of my birthright
I mean I know zero of your girl's cologne
I mean I know zero of your girl's cologne
I mean I know zero of your girl's cologne
...that sticks to my veins
...that sticks to my veins
Before fortune fell us
And we fall even further
Oh, we will feel our fortune
Oh, just singing away
Oh, just singing away
I have the future for a lie, lie, lie
We're on a course fixed by fire
She says me lies
This is the prize of my birthright
I mean I know zero of your girl's cologne
I mean I know zero of your girl's cologne
I mean I know zero of your girl's cologne
...that sticks to my veins
...that sticks to my veins
Marry me, I may be a lie
Marry me, tell me the date that I die
Who's got our future, little one?
Will there be a honeymoon, little one?
Please lie! Please lie!
But memories could walk
But I lay awake nights
Now, I can't go home, little one
Now, I don't mind chopping the wood
But the memory
Don't do no-one no good
