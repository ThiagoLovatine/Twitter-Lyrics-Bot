Pick it up, pick it all up
And start again
You've got a second chance, you could go home
Escape it all, it's just irrelevant
It's just medicine
It's just medicine

It's just medicine
It's just medicine
You could still be what you want to
What you said you were when you met me
You've got a warm heart, you've got a beautiful brain
But it's disintegrating from all the medicine
From all the medicine
From all the medicine
You could still be
What you want to
What you said you were
When I met you
When you met me
When I met you
You could still be what you want to
What you said you were when I met you
When you met me, when I met you
