Ya shakin
Bite ya nails ya breakin
Take ya actions fake it
Take ya music play it
Take ya pill and shake it
Simply erase it
You don’t wanna trace it
Runnin fast you chase it, yah
Xanax in a panic, so manic
Tanic’ you a devil so ban it
Peace is so needed for the planets
So take out some time and plan it
Cause you got tabs on ya tongue
Can't feel cause ya body so numb
Take a pill and then you try to run
Bad trip, when you hook with a gun
