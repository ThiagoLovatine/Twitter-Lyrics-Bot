Shadows settle on the place, that you left
Our minds are troubled by the emptiness
What did I do? I can not go back
What did I say? I can not go back
But can I change? I can not go back
I think I fucked up, I can not go back
I made a mistake, I can not go back
Tell me what’s wrong, I can not go back
Tell me you love me and I won’t go back
I know that I love you I will not go back
What did I do? I can not go back
What did I say? I can not go back
But can I change? I can not go back
I think I fucked up, I can not go back
I made a mistake, I can not go back
Tell me what’s wrong, I can not go back
Tell me you love me and I won’t go back
I know that I love you I will not go back
Lemme’ know, lemme’ know what I did wrong
Why you so vague? I’ll give you this song
It’s all that I got, I know it’s not long
You say that you good, you say that you fine
You say no-one loves you but I call you mine
I hope that you know that you’re one of a kind
You say you’re not good enough, why are you lying?
Look at me please, look at me now
Look at my eyes when I tell you I’m proud
I don’t get annoyed when you think that you’re loud
You make me so high I look down at the clouds, Aye
And please don’t ask for forgiveness
You’ve done nothing wrong and no please let me finish
It’s just me and you, we’re the only ones in this
Yes just me and you, and God, just let me finish
What did I do? I can not go back
What did I say? I can not go back
But can I change? I can not go back
I think I fucked up, I can not go back
I made a mistake, I can not go back
Tell me what’s wrong, I can not go back
Tell me you love me and I won’t go back
What did I do? I can not go back
What did I say? I can not go back
But can I change? I can not go back
I think I fucked up, I can not go back
I made a mistake, I can not go back
Tell me what’s wrong, I can not go back
Tell me you love me and I won’t go back
I know that I love you I will not go back
Listen to me, I won’t let you go
As long as I’m here you’ll never be alone
I’ll hold you close, my arms are your home
I hope that you know that you’ll never be thrown
I know that its happened before, know you’ve felt hated before
But I swear on my life that it will not happen no more
All I will do is just love you some more, Aye
Every small detail I’ll love you some more
You’re like a map that I want to explore
It’s true you’re my weakness, but I need you more
Cause’ you make me stronger than ever before
But I try to show it, sorry if I don’t
Better than someone who knows that they won’t
The darkness is coming but it won’t come close
Look I fucking love you don’t say that I don’t
And please don’t ask for forgiveness
I know I fuck up, and no, please let me finish
I won’t let you go we’re the only ones in this
Look I fucking love you, and thank you, I’m finished
Every conversation babe, I feel alive
You give me a feeling that I can’t describe
Its just so amazing how us two can vibe
Yes you heard me right, you bring me back to life
