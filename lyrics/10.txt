Driving home, the road makes me feel smaller
My hard fear forces my hand into the shoulder
And I feel you, darling, on my own
Every mile brings you a little closer
Yeah, I'm driving into the Hay Plain
I won't survive the night if you won't stay in your lane
Yeah, I'm heading away from that wide sunset
Wondering if my new man misses me yet
Baby, you don't have to drive me around no more
I went and got myself a car, now I can pay you back for it
All the times you took me back home
And every mile brings you a little closer
Yeah, I'm driving into the Hay Plain
I won't survive the night if you won't stay in your lane
Yeah, I'm heading away from that wide sunset
Wondering if my new man is in love with me yet
And besides that truck driver on the Western Distributor
Who caught me changing, sorry, babe, he saw everything
I've been keeping my skin for when you fly in
And you want me, physically
And besides that night in Adelaide in the back of a cab
When a good man said he'd give me what I've never had
I've been keeping my eye for when you come online
And you need me, emotionally
I'm driving into the Hay Plain
I won't survive the night if you won't stay in your lane
Yeah, I'm heading away from that wide sunset
Wondering if my new man misses me yet
