So shaky, so fine
Standin' up there, baby, oh, you look so divine
So harsh, that bright stage light
Showin' the first four rows that you don't wanna play tonight
But you know I want you to
You know I need you to
And I'll be there for you, darlin'
Even if it all falls through
So steady, so calm
Standin' up there, darlin', with the front row in the heel of your palm
So good, that bright stage light
Showin' the back four rows that you got it made here tonight
You know I want you to
You know I need you to
And I'll be there for you, darlin'
When it all starts to come true
You stepped down off our home ground
Said, "Good friend I am done"
Done
So I left the game as they yelled my name
Said, "Girl, you're my number one"
One
One
Mmm
So shaky, so fine
Standing up there, baby, oh, you look so divine
