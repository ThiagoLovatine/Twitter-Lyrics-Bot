Same airport, different man
I'm starting to think that I don't know quite who I am
Same airport, different man
He sat in the car park, waiting for me to land
Same airport, different dress
This one's blue and it is longer than the rest
Same airport, different dress
Last one was short and red and too tight for my growing chest
Same airport, different life
At sixteen, lost my first love to a one-way flight
Same airport, different life
Sat down by the carousel, looking old enough to make a wife now
Same airport, different ride home
Last time I went to my mother's, this time to my own
Same airport, different ride home
Riding shotgun to my baby, next time I'll get the train alone
I'll get the train alone
I'll get the train alone
I'll get the train alone
Same airport, different man
He looks happy, he looks happy
Same airport, different man
