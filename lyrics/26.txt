She lost the baby, the house nearly burnt down
Baby Jesus is nobody's baby now
Watched him pick the pack of smokes out of the bin
This time of year has always been so hard on him
Last Christmas, at my aunty's house
I tried so hard to make my uncle shut his mouth
Grandma cried, "Can't this wait?"
Drink a cup of juice, try to celebrate
The family asked me to sing 'em all a song
Get up in the lounge room while they keep the TV on
Pick a fun one, everybody claps
Plates of cold cuts tremble in their laps
Watch me go to bed alone this year
There was someone I wanted, but they're no longer here
Grow up, girl, it's good for your health
To go to bed sometimes simply holding yourself
She lost the baby, the house might still burn down
Baby Jesus is nobody's baby now
Wanna be there to pick her up off the floor
But I've never had to reach this far down before
This Christmas, at my aunty's house
I'm gonna try so hard to open up my mouth
Say it loud, and hope it's true
Next year will be much easier on you
