Zach Braff, you look just like my dad
Back when I thought I had the best one
Oh, what a life it could have been
Me in the cradle, you on the screen
But you're too young to be a father to me
You're too young to be a father to me
Hey, Catherine Deneuve, you look just like my mother used to
When she loved me, oh, when she loved me
Oh, what a life, just you and I
Learning to walk as you read your lines
But you're too old to be a mother to me
You're too old to be a mother to me
Surely you're not saying the TV lied?
I truly believe that they would love me back in real life
Hey, kid at the bar, you know who you are, I've been
Starin' you down as I play this out-of-tune guitar, and
Oh, just think what we could be
I swear I'll dress cooler if you'll just go home with me
But you're too young to be a lover to me
(You're too young to be a lover to me)
I'm getting older but I forget sometimes, you see
(You're too young to be a lover to me)
Surely you're not saying the TV lied?
(You're too young to be a lover to me)
I truly believe that I will have it all in my life
So, don't you waste my time
Don't you waste my time
On small talk and cheap wine
