I was once a Sunday kneeler
When I saw the leadlight fall from the pane
I didn't know that the grass was not only greener
Upkeep is cheaper when you embrace the rain
So I jumped down to lay with my leadlight
Under your spotlight, I lay with the shards
And I didn't know that the ground was not only harder
Oh, but colder when you are not around
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't let possession make a fool of you
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't promise I'll be here to see this whole love through
So I ran with dreams to reach the skyline
Straight up that incline, I ran towards the blue
And I didn't know that the sky is not only wider
Oh, but clearer when I'm standing next to you
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't let possession make a fool of you
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't promise I'll be here to see this whole love through
Oh, I believe in trust you see
But don't you go and put your trust in me
I cost more than you earn
So tell me, boy, why didn't you ever learn?
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't let possession make a fool of you
I love you my darling, I do
But I can't promise I'll be here to see this whole love through
