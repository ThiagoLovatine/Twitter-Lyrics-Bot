Why'd you go to the grocery store
On the day you planned to leave?
You left me here with all this food
My body does not need
And now I'm lying listless
Like a dog after a feed
Thinking 'bout the life
That you'll now lead
Why'd you go and push in
When you saw my face in the line?
You said if I just focus
I could get laid anytime
But now I'm lying broken
Like a dog after a fight
I guess I was not made for your life
I guess I was not made for your life
There on Central Station
You forced my lips to scream
Loving you ain't easy, babe
It's just a L.A. dream
And I'll be lying happy
Knowing we still spent the time
I guess you were not meant to be mine
I guess you were not meant to be mine
