Don't let the kids win
Just let them lose
They're not gonna learn anything
If that's the way you choose to play
Don't let the kids win
Just let them fall
You don't want 'em growing up thinking
Two-year-olds are good at playing basketball
Don't let your grandmother die
While you're away
A cheap trip to Thailand's not gonna make up
For never getting to say goodbye
And don't let your brother
Stop thinking you're cool
Yeah, I know, he's got a girlfriend now and he's taller
But that don't mean he's stopped looking up to you
And I've got a feeling
That this won't ever change
We're gonna keep on getting older
It's gonna keep on feeling strange
Don't let your friends turn cold
While you burn to green
When they walk off the stage, embrace them
And say, "That's the best shit I've ever seen"
And don't let your sister
Walk down the aisle
Without pulling her close, saying, "I love you"
And, "It's okay if I don't see you for a while"
And I've got a feeling
That this won't ever change
We're gonna keep on getting older
It's gonna keep on feeling strange
And don't let the time go by
Without sitting your mother down
And asking what life was like for her
Before you came to be around
And tell her it's okay
If she puts herself first
Us kids, we'll be alright
If we're not the centre of her universe
And I've got a feeling
That this won't ever change
We're gonna keep on getting older
It's gonna keep on feeling strange
And after a late one
I don't know anything
Except the more I keep on talking
The less breath I got left to sing
