I was dancing
For a while
See, I was trying to
Perfect a style
Out on that dance floor
Oh, boy, did I sweat
Shaking to get noticed
Has not worked for me yet
But I'll keep trying
See, I was swinging
My blonde hair 'round
See, I was trying to
Get my feet off the ground
And I rose steady
To the roof of my room
I may not be a great dancer
But I might be a good one soon
Yeah, I'll keep trying
Dancing for yourself ain't bad when you're dying to find
That sweet step that will help to free your mind
