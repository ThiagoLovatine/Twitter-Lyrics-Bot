I loved it there
That city held me
Don't you know that everything changes?
Inside the dream
A case for wanting
Don't you know that everything changes?
Everything changes
When the time comes
Will you get on that flight?
I got a feeling I won't do it alone
I got a feeling
But everything changes
Everything changes
Everything changes
Everything is changing
Everything is changing
I loved it there
That city held me
I got a feeling I won't do it alone
It's just a feeling though
