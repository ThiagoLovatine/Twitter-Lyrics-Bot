Hiding my depression from my housemates
I don't know them well enough yet to cry in the kitchen
Shower head or the empty bed
I yell down the hallway, "I'm going to the store"
But instead I walk to the local football field
And I walk around in circles, find a quiet corner and cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Open your eyes, run back, baby
But they'll think that I am a liar if I come home empty-handed
Go, use your head, buy another loaf of bread
When I walk back through the door, I'll say
"You can never have too much bread," and try not to cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
I make them food
I make them laugh
I say, "I'll clean up
You should get an early night"
I stop and I wait
Stuck in my new state
I close the kitchen door and
Hold onto the sink and cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh, cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
