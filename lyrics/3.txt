I gotta find myself a girl
Who makes me wanna take on the world
I gotta find myself a girl
Who makes my straight toes curl
See, I had a life in my head
I'd be pushing up that hill
Until those toes bled
And now I'm gonna learn this new stage
I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
I didn't see it coming, I must have shucked that rage
Yeah, I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
Yeah, now I'm alright, I'm doing fine
But I'll be pushing up that hill
Until I get what's mine
Yeah, now I'm gonna learn this new stage
I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
I didn't see it coming, I must have shucked that rage
Yeah, I didn't see it coming, my coming of age
Whoa
Ooh
Whoa
